### 👋 About Me

Hello! As an engineering enthusiast interested in artificial intelligence and control technologies, I enjoy developing innovative projects that bring hardware and software together. Producing technological and sustainable solutions to real-world problems from an engineering perspective is always among my priorities.

I actively use programming languages ​​such as Python, C and C++; I develop embedded systems, sensor-based applications and artificial intelligence-supported projects with these languages. I produce various hardware-based projects with ARM-based microcontrollers and work with professional tools such as Altium Designer in circuit design processes. I also focus on image processing techniques using OpenCV in the field of control and automation systems and work on applications such as object recognition and tracking.

In line with my interest in robotic technologies, I aim to continuously improve my knowledge and skills in this field. I am highly motivated to collaborate with people who share the same passion and I continue to use my technical expertise to produce innovative and effective solutions.

    🌍 I'm based in Izmir, Turkey
